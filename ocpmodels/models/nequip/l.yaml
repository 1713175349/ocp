# `model_builders` defines a series of functions that will be called to construct the model
# each model builder has the opportunity to update the model, the config, or both
# model builders from other packages are allowed (see mir-group/allegro for an example); those from `nequip.model` don't require a prefix
# these are the default model builders:
model_builders:
#  - SimpleIrrepsConfig         # update the config with all the irreps for the network if using the simplified `l_max` / `num_features` / `parity` syntax
 - EnergyModel                # build a full NequIP model
#  - PerSpeciesRescale          # add per-atom / per-species scaling and shifting to the NequIP model before the total energy sum
 - ForceOutput                # wrap the energy model in a module that uses autodifferention to compute the forces
#  - RescaleEnergyEtc           # wrap the entire model in the appropriate global rescaling of the energy, forces, etc.
#   ^ global rescaling blocks must always go last!
